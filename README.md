# GraphQL-API runtime on top of PouchDB

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MikeBild/graphql-pouch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MikeBild/graphql-pouch)

*A GraphQL-API runtime on top of PouchDB created by GraphQL shorthand notation as a self contained service with CouchDB synchonisation.*

__Objectives - evaluating for your project__

* Frontend-First-Driven approach without backend/database migrations
* Friendly GraphQL shorthand notation spec to create typed data model definitions fast and easy
* Self-contained // no infrastructure dependencies // no lock in
* Customizable for seamless integration of existing resources

## Usage
First install using npm:

```bash
npm install -g graphql-pouch
```

and then just run it!

```bash
graphql-pouch
```

For more information run:

```bash
graphql-pouch -h
```

##GraphiQL UI for development becomes standard

[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) is a awesome web based tool by Facebook to let you interactively explore your data and your API. When development mode is enabled in GraphQL-Pouch, the GraphiQL interface will be automatically displayed at your GraphQL endpoint.

__Example__

```bash
graphql-pouch --development
```

```bash
Listen on port 3000
CouchDB sync URL: none
Relay enabled: true
Development mode: true
JWT-Authentication: false

Supported GraphQL schemas:
cms initialized and running - http://127.0.0.1:3000/graphql/cms
```

Navigate to the URL printed to your console after starting GraphQL-Pouch and use GraphiQL to fetch your data. When you want to use GraphQL-Pouch in production mode, the [GraphiQL-App](https://github.com/skevy/graphiql-app) is ideally suited.

## GraphQL and Relay

Check out the [CMS example](https://github.com/MikeBild/graphql-pouch/tree/master/example/cms-relay) for a demo of GraphQL-Pouch, Relay and React in action.

## Benefits

GraphQL-Pouch uses the joint benefits of PouchDB and GraphQL to provide a number of key benefits.

* 100% GraphQL compliant (supports pure GraphQL mode)
* [100% Relay](doc/using-relay.md) compliant
* [Command Line Interface](doc/CLI.md)
* [JWT Authentication support](doc/jwt-authentication.md)
* [Custom GraphQL-Queries and Mutations](doc/custom-functions.md) via JavaScript functions
* Fully documented API and [GraphiQL-UI](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) for development
* [Serves multiple GraphQL schemas](doc/multi-graphql.md)
* [Using GraphQL-Pouch as a NPM-Module](doc/npm-module.md)
* [Completely self contained with Master/Master Replication](doc/replication.md)
* Supports relationships, types, comments, pagination, and more providing by GraphQL, PouchDB and CouchDB
* Serves static files for e.g. React-Application hosting

## Roadmap
In the future, things that GraphQL-Pouch will include:

* HTTPS Support
* Mock/Fake data results
* Runtime traceability using resolver timings
* Role based authorization
* MongoDB query language inspired subselections
* DataLoader for batching and caching optimization
* Subscriptions using PouchDB change notifications

and, of course:

* better documentation
* better validation and error messages
* better debug logs
* more tests
* more examples

## Run Tests
